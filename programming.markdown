## Programming projects

* I am currently working on a fluid structure interaction problem for my postdoc. It concerns aspects of the coupling between a compressible gas and a solid structure.  

# Github

My github account can be found [here](https://github.com/stmcgovern).

* CPPLS (Coupled Pore Pressure with Level Sets)

  * I developed this application code during my doctoral research. It concerns the simulation of a sedimentary basin, written with the [deal.II](https://dealii.org) library in C++.

<!-- * Stefan Phase Change
  * I am developing a didactic simulation code to solve the interface
