# PhD Thesis

My thesis in Geophysics at the University of Bonn, Germany is available at the library website [here](https://bonndoc.ulb.uni-bonn.de/xmlui/handle/20.500.11811/8443).

The topic concerns sedimentary basin modeling and the introduction of an implicit interface tracking method, the level set method, to evolve the stratigraphy of a basin over geological time. 

The model consists of numerically solving partial differential equations describing aspects of the physical state. 

A priority for the project was to construct the application code such that it can run in a distributed parallel environment. 

Below are a series of naturally occurring examples of sedimentary rock stratigraphy.
