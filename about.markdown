# Interests
Through using computational tools, like the numerical solution of partial differential equations, I am interested in mathematical modeling of physical phenomena. 


# Recent Work
+ Since December 2019, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the *Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique* (INRIA-Sophia Antipolis) and the Mathematics Department (*Laboratoire Jean-Alexandre Dieudonne*) at the University of Cote d'Azur in Nice, France. My advisor is Dr. Laurent Monasse.

+ I completed a PhD (*Doctor rerum naturalium*) in Geophysics at the University of Bonn, Germany in 2020. I conducted my research mainly at the *Forschungszentrum Juelich* (Research Center Juelich) in the Institute for Bio-and Geosciences 3 - Agrosphere. My advisor was Prof. Stefan Kollet.
