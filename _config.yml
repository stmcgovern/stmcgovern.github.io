# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This is my, Sean T. McGovern, professional website. 
  I am interested in using computational methods to deepen understanding of physical processes.
  Computer simulations are powerful tools to explore a wide variety of areas of inquiry.
  I have degrees in physics and philosophy, and have a doctorate in natural science (Dr. rer. nat.).
